# Amicable-Numbers
A python algorithm for finding all amicable numbers up to a given whole number.
Amicable Numbers are defined as the folowing:
Let d(x) be defined as the sum of proper divisors of x (numbers less than x which divide evenly into x).
If d(a) = b and d(b) = a, where a â‰  b, then a and b are an amicable pair and each of a and b are called amicable numbers.
Change the n in the final print line to return a list of all amicable numbers up to and including the number you choose.
